# 42.A sentence splitter is a program capable of splitting a text into sentences. The standard set of heuristics for sentence splitting includes (but isn't limited to) the following rules:
# Sentence boundaries occur at one of "." (periods), "?" or "!", except that

# Periods followed by whitespace followed by a lower case letter are not sentence boundaries.
# Periods followed by a digit with no intervening whitespace are not sentence boundaries.
# Periods followed by whitespace and then an upper case letter, but preceded by any of a short list of titles are not sentence boundaries. Sample titles include Mr., Mrs., Dr., and so on.
# Periods internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace are not sentence boundaries (for example, www.aptex.com, or e.g).
# Periods followed by certain kinds of punctuation (notably comma and more periods) are probably not sentence boundaries.
